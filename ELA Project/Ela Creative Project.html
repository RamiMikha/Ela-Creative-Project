                <h4> This project will be going through the main events regarding Elie Wiesel's life to understand how the adversity he faced affected his belief in God and his human spirit. This is done by a website I created in which each page will be highlighting one main event and relating it to the question. The final page will contain the complete answer to the question.<br> This took a long time to make from scratch so I hope you enjoy :) </h4>
