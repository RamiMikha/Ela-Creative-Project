                <h4>In the face of clear defeat, Nazi forces evacuated Auschwitz, beginning a death march across Eastern Europe and into Germany. Wiesel and his father, separated from his two sisters, were taken to Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. As hinted with this march's name, many suffered greatly and sadly many did not make it to the camp alive.</h4>
