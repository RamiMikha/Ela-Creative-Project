                <h4>From a young age, Elie Wiesel faced unimaginable situations leaving him with a gap in his believes and moral standards. Adversity results in the loss of self-identity, innocence, and moral values resulting in great darkness in a person's believes. The above picture shows a sketch of Elie sitting in complete darkness. I believe this represents well how one might feel after such adversity. His facial expression shows that he is carrying a lot of guilt and trauma within him. The darkness all around him represents the feeling of emptiness as he had lost everything, including his strong belief in God as we can see in the book. Wiesel felt as if there was no God when he is asked to help. He saw that God did not help his family and friends or him. This caused him to be very close to giving in to death since his belief in God had been his motivation his entire life beforehand. The adversity seen in the events mentioned had completely destroyed his human spirit.</h4>
