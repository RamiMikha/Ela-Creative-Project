                <h4>Elie Wiesel faced unimaginable situations from a young age, leaving him with a gap in his beliefs and moral standards. Adversity results in the loss of self-identity, innocence, and moral values resulting in great darkness in a person's faith. The above picture shows a sketch of Elie sitting in complete darkness. I believe this represents well how one might feel after the adversities that were mentioned. The site went through some of the most significant points in the story that affected Elieâ€™s spirit the most. At many points, the strength of the adversity Elie has to face is tremendous, making the reader wonder how he made it through the roughest of times. Elie had lost his father and felt so empty, and he no longer believed he can continue to push through, realization sets in and he begins to think there is nothing left to live for. His facial expression shows that he is carrying a lot of guilt and trauma within him. After all that had happened Elie felt darkness within him like a core factor of who he was had vanished. He saw that God did not help his family and friends or him. This caused him to be very close to giving in to death since the hope in God and his father he had was his motivation his entire life beforehand. The adversity seen in the events mentioned throughout the site had destroyed his human spirit. Elie was no longer the passionate young teenager he once was.</h4>
