                <h4>In their stay in Auschwitz, Elie Wiesel and the other inmates were only given very small rations and were forced into hard labour. The sick were killed if they were not able to work. Here is where we see Elie start to question God's plan for him. His once significant passion and belief starts to diminish suddenly. Elie can be seen in this picture laying in the second from the bottom layer, 7th from the left.</h4>
