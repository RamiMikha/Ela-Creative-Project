                <h4>In May 1944, the ghettos of Sighet were liquidated and all of the Jews in the ghettos were transported to Auschwitz. Elie Wiesel, his father, and his two older sisters survived the initial selection process and became part of the working population of the camp. However, his mother and younger sister were killed upon arrival. Already we see Elie having to face horrible adversity that no one would not wish even on their worst enemies, the separation and death of his mother.</h4>
