                <h4>Following illness, starvation, and a severe beating, Shlomo Wiesel died not long before the liberation of Buchenwald. At this point, everyone was near death and all hope was lost. Elie no longer thought of God. For one to have devoted his entire life to this belief at first, to now no longer even giving it a thought, shows just how much adversity can change people.</h4>
