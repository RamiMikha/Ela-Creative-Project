                <h4>Elie Wiesel was Liberated. American forces reached Buchenwald in April 1945, liberating the camp and beginning to provide aid to the prisoners remaining alive in the camp. This was the end of the book Night. The final part shows the impact of the trauma caused as Elie says "From the depth of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me never left me." Elie was extremely close to death and was lucky to be liberated that day, but his trauma and the effect it had on him will always be part of who he is.</h4>
